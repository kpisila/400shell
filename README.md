Running the Program

To run the program simply download shell.c and Makefile. Open a terminal, change directory to the location where you have stored these files and type “make”. Once that completes simply type “./shell” to begin the shell. You should see a “~ ” at the beginning of the next line if the program is working properly. At this point you can begin entering commands.
